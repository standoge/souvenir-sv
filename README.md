# El Salvador souvenir

This Python package scrapes [this web](https://www.listasal.info/articulos/codigo-postal-el-salvador.shtml) to get zip codes by municipality. It uses `Requests` with `BeautifulSoup` to extract that information, which is then returned as a dictionary or JSON.
 ## Install üõ†Ô∏è

This package can be installed with **PIP** as a dependency:

```bash
pip install souvenir-sv
```

## How to use ü™ê

```python
# for department/municipalities zip-codes scraper
from souvenir.zipcode import Endpoint, Zipcode 
# for department images scraper
from souvenir.image import ImageBing, ImageGoogle
```
> ImageGoogle scraper requires an API Key to work, which means that you have to sign in on the author's package website to get access to the scraper. ImageBing does not need it.

### Zip-codes:

```python
# return endpoint to extract data in web source
my_department:str = Endpoint.san_salvador.value
# scrapes web source to get municipalities with its zip codes
san_salvador_zipcodes:object = Zipcode(my_department)
# retur a dict with municipalities and its zip codes
san_salvador_zipcodes.zip_codes
```

You must expect a dictionary like this.

```json
{
  "Aguilares": "01122",
  "Apopa": "01123",
  "Ayutuxtepeque": "01121",
  "Delgado": "01118",

}
```

### Images:
You can check package's documentation from author's repositories. 
[ImageBing](https://github.com/ffreemt/bing-image-urls) and [ImageGoogle](https://github.com/arrrlo/Google-Images-Search).

```python
# this step is shared with Zipcode class to choice which department scrape
my_department:str = Endpoint.san_salvador.value

# return urls from Bing engine
bing_images:List[str] = ImageBing(my_department).images

# return urls from Google engine
google_images:List[str] = ImageBIng(my_department,api_key).images
```
